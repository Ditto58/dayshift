The dsaf trilogy.
This is just containing the trilogy. Maybe a bit basic, but it shall work for some. Not me. Others can access .github.io sites, but not me. any comments, or issues, come to me. there may or may not be saving. I apologise if there is not. It should save in your browser local storage, but... no idea.
