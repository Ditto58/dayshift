The dsaf trilogy.
This is just containing the trilogy. Maybe a bit basic, but it shall work for some. Not me. Others can access .github.io sites, but not me. any comments, or issues, come to me. there may or may not be saving. I apologise if there is not. It should save in your browser local storage, but... no idea.
Oh, and this is only for a few people. If this link is handed out in this school, I WILL TAKE IT DOWN. FOREVER. IT WILL NOT BE BROUGHT BACK. That being said, enjoy, the few people that can. Seriously though, don't share it. I don't need to get in trouble.
